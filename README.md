# GOre-Name
It's a dead simple file renaming tool, changes all ` ` to `_` and letters with accents to it's non accent pair.

Just run the binary for rename the current folder's content.

Got a `-path=/path/to/workdir` flag but on default run, it will use the current workfolder.ğŸ› 

Generates a csv file with the new file names init. ğŸ“±
